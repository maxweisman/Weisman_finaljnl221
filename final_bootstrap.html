				<p class="lead"> Over the last three MLB seasons, the team that won the most amount of games, the Los Angeles Dodgers at 255, spent the second highest amount of money on their top ten players in their payroll, at $341,028,087. However, the team that won the second highest amount of games in that span, the Tampa Bay Rays at 236, spent the fourth <i>least</i> amount of money on their ten highest paid players, at $98,571,838.</p>

				<h3>Spend-More-To-Win-More. Does it Work?</h3>
				<p>In the MLB there is no salary cap like in the NBA, NHL, or NFL. Teams can spend as much money as they want. There is a luxury tax threshold, however, a number set at $210,000,000 for the 2021 season. If a team spends even one dollar over 210 million, that one dollar comes out of the team owner’s, or the team itself’s, pocket. The luxury tax is a very confusing process, and one that would take a long time to explain. <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/explaining-mlbs-luxury-tax-and-why-it-shouldnt-be-having-a-major-impact-on-free-agency/" target="blank">(CBS Sports’ Matt Snyder does a great job explaining the luxury tax and its impact on free agency in his February 2019 article)</a>. The point is that teams who make more money seem to have an unfair advantage. They can afford to go over the tax threshold because they make and have the money to pay for it. This is the case in teams in bigger markets. For example, since 2003, the top three teams in terms of luxury tax paid are the New York Yankees, the Los Angeles Dodgers, and the Boston Red Sox, arguably the three most recognizable MLB teams. These teams can afford to go over the tax because they make a lot of money, through merchandise sales, ticket sales, and team performance with these three teams consistently being towards the top of the standings each year. <a href="https://www.stationindex.com/tv/tv-markets" target="blank">They also play in large media markets.</a> The Yankees dominate the New York market over their crosstown rivals the Mets, the Dodgers do the same to the Angels, and the Red Sox play in the seventh largest media market in the country. (For reference, Toronto's media market, which isn't listed on that site because it's in Canada, would be the second largest media market in the US, behind only New York)</p>
				<p>From 2019-2021, two of those teams, the Dodgers and Yankees, spent the highest money on their ten highest paid players. The Yankees at the most, and the Dodgers the second most (the Red Sox were fourth most). When translating that to wins, it’s not a perfect comparison. While the Yankees spent the most in that span, they won the fourth highest number of games, behind the Dodgers, whose home stadium Dodger Stadium is depicted in the bottom image, the Tampa Bay Rays, whose home stadium Tropicana Field is depicted in the top image, and the Houston Astros. The Rays are a ridiculously big outlier. They spent the fourth least amount of money on their ten highest paid players in the past three years, but stunned the baseball world by winning consistently at a high level. The bottom five teams in terms of payroll in this scenario are the Pittsburgh Pirates, the Baltimore Orioles, the Miami Marlins, the Tampa Bay Rays, and the Arizona Diamondbacks, respectively. Of those teams, four of them rank in the bottom seven in terms of wins from 2019-2021. The Rays however, have won the second most games while spending the fourth least on their players, making them a huge outlier when talking about spending translating to wins. An outlier in the opposite direction is the aforementioned Boston Red Sox. They spent the fourth highest amount of money on their highest ten players from 2019-2021, but only won the 12th highest amount of games in that span. I could keep talking about teams who don’t fit the spend-more-to-win-more mold, but if you take a look at the graph below, you’ll see plenty of teams who either spend less and win more, like the Rays and the Oakland Athletics, and teams who spend more and win less, like the Red Sox and the St. Louis Cardinals.</p>

      <h3>Unsurprisingly, it's About the Production of the Team on the Field</h3>
      <p>It should come as no surprise that the best teams aren’t the ones who spend the most money, but are the ones who play the best. In the MLB, parity is very high. The last team to win back to back World Series were the <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/back-to-back-world-series-champions-c297636124" target="blank">New York Yankees</a>, when they won three in a row from 1998-2000. In other major sports leagues in the US, back to back champs happen relatively often. In the NBA, the most recent back to back champs were the <a href="https://www.landofbasketball.com/championships/year_by_year.htm" target="blank">Golden State Warriors</a> in 2017 and 2018. In the NHL, the <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/sports/lightning/2021/07/07/elite-8-lightning-join-exclusive-back-to-back-stanley-cup-club/#:~:text=Tampa%20Bay%20is%20the%20first,Penguins%20in%202016%20and%202017.&text=The%20Lightning%20have%20done%20it,it%20in%202016%20and%202017." target="blank">Tampa Bay Lightning</a> are currently back to back champs, looking to make it a three-peat this season. In the NFL, the most recent iteration of this was when the <a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/2021/02/07/how-many-teams-have-won-back-to-back-super-bowls" target="blank">New England Patriots</a> won two Super Bowls in a row in 2004 and 2005. One reason it’s so hard to win back to back in the MLB is because of the length of its season, 162 games. A lot can happen over that many games. In fact, take a look at every team’s win totals in 2019 and 2021, the last two full MLB seasons <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/24/882678448/major-league-baseball-comes-back-for-shorter-season-after-coronavirus-shutdown" target="blank">(2020 was a 60 game season due to the COVID-19 Pandemic)</a>. 15 teams increased their win total from 2019 to 2021, 14 teams decreased their win total, and 1 team had the same amount of wins. </p>

				<p>Why is this? Well, like I mentioned earlier, it’s about the team that is fielded, and not about how much money a team throws at big name free agents. If a team pays top dollar for the big name free agents in an offseason, but those players don’t produce on the field in the level they were expected to, the team won’t find success on the field. The New York Mets spent <a href="https://www.spotrac.com/mlb/new-york-mets/payroll/2021/" target="blank">$124,966,668</a> on their highest ten paid players this year, including adding star shortstop Francisco Lindor from the Cleveland Indians. The signing didn’t pay off, however, as <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/l/lindofr01.shtml" target="blank">Lindor’s stats regressed from his 2020 numbers, and pretty significantly from his 2019 numbers,</a> and the Mets missed the playoffs, finishing with a 77-85 record. </p>
				<p>Steve Perrault, Senior Producer of MLB Content at Audacy Sports, says throwing money at free agents can work in making a team better, but there are so many other important parts in fielding a successful baseball team. “Bigger payroll gives you a higher opportunity to increase wins but that's still not always the direct correlation when it comes to MLB. So many other factors play a role with winning games that a bigger payroll will only put you in a better position on paper vs. in reality to stack up wins,” he says. This makes sense. Throwing money at problems that a team has to plug certain holes will make a team <i>look</i> better, but there are thousands, if not millions of factors that influence how a team plays day in and day out. </p>
				<p>A big problem people say baseball has is that smaller market teams don’t have enough money to dole out to players to compete with teams in bigger markets. Perrault disagrees. “Every MLB team has the money to pay the players what they demand, but only a few are actually willing to give out those huge contracts. Teams like the [Oakland Athletics] and [the Tampa Bay] Rays have found other ways to field competitive teams than just throwing huge deals around, but that does take a lot more effort from the scouting department and front office,” he says. Both the Athletics and the Rays are in the top ten of <i>least</i> amount of money paid to their highest ten players, but are both in the top ten of <i>most</i> amount of wins from 2019-2021. The A’s and the Rays have found ways to put great teams on the field while not spending a ton of money. Do they utilize the scouting team and the front office more effectively than other teams? We can’t really be sure. We can, however, appreciate the fact that they have a system in place to get good players on their team while spending within their limits, setting up possibilities for small market teams to compete with big market teams. Thereby increasing parity in the MLB where a handful of teams won’t win every year just by spending big, and increasing interest in the game throughout the country.</p>
